Getting the Hystrix Dashboard requires now to enter hystrix stream in dashboard in the following form:

http://localhost:8010/actuator/hystrix.stream

and NOT anymore like this: 

http://localhost:8010/hystrix.stream

A change is also required in the configuration:

management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: hystrix.stream
